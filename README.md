# Signature Recognition and Verification System

## Project Overview
This project is a **Signature Recognition and Verification System** designed to verify handwritten signatures for biometric security applications. By leveraging image processing and machine learning, this system captures, processes, and analyzes signatures to authenticate users. It provides a real-time assessment of authenticity, making it suitable for applications in banking, legal, and other industries requiring secure identity verification.

## Features
- **Signature Capture:** Capture signatures in real-time using a webcam or upload image files.
- **Image Processing:** Uses grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and thresholding to prepare the image for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Applies techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), contour detection, and zoning for accurate feature extraction.
- **Signature Comparison:** Compares input signatures with stored references to verify authenticity using machine learning algorithms.
- **User Interface:** Built with Tkinter, providing a user-friendly GUI for easy navigation.
